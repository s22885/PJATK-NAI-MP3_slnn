The Shwethalyaung Buddha ရွှေသာလျောင်းရုပ်ပွားတော်ကြီး) is a reclining Buddha statue. The Buddha, which has a length of 55 metres (180 ft) and a height of 16 metres (52 ft), is believed to have been built in 994, during the reign of Mon King Migadepa. It was lost in 1757 when Pegu was pillaged. During British colonial rule, in 1880, the Shwethalyaung Buddha was rediscovered under a cover of jungle growth. Restoration began in 1881, and Buddha's mosaic pillows (on its left side) were added in 1930.
